# BLS Bridge

A robust blockchain ledger synchronization infrastructure for secure, cross-chain interoperability and validation.

## Overview

BLS Bridge is a cutting-edge blockchain technology built with Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain, enabling seamless and secure cross-chain communication and data synchronization.

## Core Components

The platform consists of four primary smart contracts:

### BLS Registry (`bls-registry`)
- Manages participant and validator registration
- Handles cryptographic key management
- Controls access and permissions
- Stores validator reputation and stake information

### BLS Bridge Core (`bls-bridge-core`)
- Implements core cross-chain bridge logic
- Supports multiple blockchain network interactions
- Manages transaction verification and validation
- Maintains transaction state and audit logs

### BLS Gateway (`bls-gateway`)
- Validates and routes cross-chain transactions
- Supports multiple verification methods:
  - Cryptographic signature verification
  - Multi-party consensus
  - Threshold signature schemes
  - Oracle-based validation
- Assigns trust scores and transaction confidence levels

### BLS Validator (`bls-validator`)
- Manages validator node operations
- Issues rewards for successful validation
- Implements stake-based participation
- Provides economic incentives for network security

## Smart Contract Highlights

### Key Features
- Secure multi-signature transaction validation
- Decentralized bridge infrastructure
- Economic incentive mechanisms
- High-performance cross-chain communication

## Getting Started

To interact with the BLS Bridge:

1. Register as a validator using the `bls-registry`
2. Initialize cross-chain transactions through the `bls-bridge-core`
3. Validate and route transactions via the `bls-gateway`
4. Earn rewards through the `bls-validator` contract

## Future Roadmap

Planned enhancements include:
- Advanced cryptographic verification methods
- Support for additional blockchain networks
- Enhanced validator reputation systems
- Zero-knowledge proof integrations
- Decentralized governance mechanisms
